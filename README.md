# Robot-Sokoban
A desktop-based puzzle game.

This game allows the player to control a robot to push boxes inside an enclosed area towards their storage locations. Different levels have been created with increasing difficulty level.

Some of the floor squares will have a certain amount of boxes which have to be pushed to the storage locations marked on the floor with an 'X'. The rest of the area will be empty for the robot to move freely.
The robot can move horizontally and vertically to push the boxes but it can never move outside of the wall nor go past the boxes.
If one of the boxes is pushed in such a way that it is positioned to the corner of the wall, then the robot will no longer be able to alter that boxâ€Ÿs position and he must press the 'repeat' button to go back to his previous move and not push that box in that position.
The boxes can only be pushed and not pulled back.
The number of boxes on each level will be equal to the storage locations.
The puzzle will be solved when all the boxes will be pushed to the storage location after which the player will move on to the next level.

To play the game, download all the java files and run them in any Java editor. The 'Menu' class will be used to initiate the game.
